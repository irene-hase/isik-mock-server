## About The Project

This is a simple implementation of ISiK Level 3 and 5 specifications to be used as a simulation for testing purposes. It
is based on the [HAPI FHIR Starter Project](https://github.com/hapifhir/hapi-fhir-jpaserver-starter).

> [!WARNING]
> ISiK Level 3 support in this Mock Server Implementation has reached the End-of-Life and will be removed with the next major release.
> If you want to test further against this Mock Server for ISiK Level 3, please use the latest 3.4.5 Version.

### Release Notes

See [ReleaseNotes.md](./ReleaseNotes.md) for all information regarding the (newest) releases.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java (JDK) installed: JDK 21 or newer.
- Apache Maven build tool (3.8+)
- Alternatively: Docker

### Installation

To build and run the mock server, you can use Docker or deploy the WAR file on a Apache Tomcat server.

#### Using Docker

You can run the server as a Docker Container with an in-memory Database by issuing the command:

```bash
docker run --rm -it -p 8080:8080 gematik1/isik-mock-server:latest
```

#### Using Docker Compose

You can run the server as a Docker Container with dedicated PostgreSQL Database by issuing the command:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

The server will then be accessible at http://localhost:8080/fhir and eg. http://localhost:8080/fhir/metadata after some
seconds (usually 30-60).

## Usage

Once started the server is accessible at http://localhost:8080/fhir and the CapabilityStatement will be found
at http://localhost:8080/fhir/metadata.

Please refer to the main HAPI FHIR Jpa Server documentation for further information about the general server
functionality: [HAPI FHIR Jpa Server Documentation](https://github.com/hapifhir/hapi-fhir-jpaserver-starter/blob/master/README.md)

### ISiK-specific Features

#### Loading external Resources

This Mock Server comes with some example FHIR Resources that are loaded on startup. You can add your own resources by
providing a folder containing FHIR Resources in JSON or XML format.

To do this, you need to set the property `example-fhir-resources.directory` in the `application.yml` file to the path of
your folder. The server will then load all the FHIR Resources from that folder on startup.

If you use the Docker Image, you can mount a volume in the container to provide the folder with your custom resources.
For example:

```bash
docker run --rm -it -p 8080:8080 \
  -v /path/to/your/resources:/fhir-resources \
  -e EXAMPLE_FHIR_RESOURCES_DIRECTORY=/fhir-resources \
   gematik1/isik-mock-server:latest
```

#### General Design Decisions regarding ISiK

##### Non-acceptance of instances on CREATE that are not ISiK compliant

Although ISiK generally permits compatibility with non‑ISiK‑compliant instances for historical data (particularly when
returning data in a READ interaction), this server implementation does not adopt a liberal approach that would accept
such instances during a CREATE interaction. The server rejects CREATE requests if the supplied resources are not
conformant with an existing ISiK profile.

##### Instances that are not ISiK compliant

This ISiK server may persist instances that are not ISiK compliant. These emulate legacy or historical data which a
client should still be able to process in a READ interaction using appropriate error handling.

#### FHIR Resource Validation with the `gematik Referenzvalidator`

Every FHIR resource that is being sent to the server via a `POST` or `PUT` request is being validated with
the [gematik Referenzvalidator](https://github.com/gematik/app-referencevalidator) using
the [ISIK-3 Plugins](https://github.com/gematik/app-referencevalidator-plugins?tab=readme-ov-file#isik3) or
the [ISIK-5](https://github.com/gematik/app-referencevalidator-plugins/releases/tag/isik5-1.0.0) one. If a resource
is not valid it gets rejected and a response with an OperationOutcome containing the validation errors is being sent
back to the client. Only resources that are valid will be accepted.

#### Accepted Media-Types

The server accepts XML and JSON. Clients can choose between XML and JSON representation, but must indicate which
representation has been selected in the HTTP Accept and Content-Type
headers ([cf. ISiK v3 Specification](https://simplifier.net/guide/isik-basis-v3/UebergreifendeFestlegungen-Repraesentationsformate?version=current), [cf. ISiK v5 Specification](https://simplifier.net/guide/isik-basis-stufe-5/Einfuehrung/Festlegungen/UebergreifendeFestlegungen_Repraesentationsformate?version=current)).

#### Booking Appointments - `Appointment/$book`

The server implements the Operation for booking Appointments according to the
official [ISiK v5 Specification](https://simplifier.net/guide/isik-terminplanung-stufe-5/Einfuehrung?version=5.1.1)
or [ISiK v3 Specification](https://simplifier.net/guide/isik-terminplanung-v3/ImplementationGuide-markdown-Datenobjekte-Operations?version=current),
according to the Profile of the Resources.

Plausibility checks:

* Start date of the appointment must be in the future
* Status must be `proposed`
* serviceType must use the CodeSystem `http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/service-type`
* The referenced slot must have the status `free`
* The referenced patient must not have been deleted and must not have the status active=false
* The start and end times in the appointment must be identical to the slot start/end times or lie between them

Also, the server automatically creates a busy Slot when none is provided — ensuring no overlaps and converting
overlapping free slots — then associates it with the new appointment.

#### Asynchronous Booking of Appointments

Clients can also book Appointments asynchronously. To do this they need to add a `Prefer-Header` that contains
`respond-async`. The server will then send a response with status `202` and a `Content-Location-Header` that contains
the url where the client can later access the result of the asynchronous booking job. To access the result of the
asynchronous job the client needs to do a `GET` request with the url from the `Content-Location-Header`.

#### Updating Appointments

The server implements updating Appointments according to the chapter `Aktualisierung / Absage eines Termins` from the
official [ISiK v5 Specification](https://simplifier.net/guide/isik-terminplanung-stufe-5/Einfuehrung/Festlegungen/Operations?version=5.1.1)
or [ISiK v3 Specification](https://simplifier.net/guide/isik-terminplanung-v3/ImplementationGuide-markdown-Datenobjekte-Operations?version=current).

Plausibility checks:

* `Appointment.slot` MUST NOT be changed
* `Appointment.start` MUST NOT be changed
* `Appointment.end` MUST NOT be changed
* `Appointment.participant.actor.where(resolve() is Patient)` MUST NOT be changed
* The referenced patient MUST NOT be deleted and MUST NOT have the status `active=false`

#### Rescheduling Appointments

The server implements rescheduling of Appointments as described in the `cancelled-appt-id` parameter in the
official [ISiK v5 Specification](https://simplifier.net/guide/isik-terminplanung-stufe-5/Einfuehrung/Festlegungen/Operations?version=5.1.1)
or [ISiK v3 Specification](https://simplifier.net/guide/isik-terminplanung-v3/ImplementationGuide-markdown-Datenobjekte-Operations?version=current).

* All plausibility checks from the chapter `Booking Appointments` need to be fulfilled here as well.
* A reference to the cancelled appointment is stored in the new appointment.
* The status of the cancelled appointment is set to `cancelled`.

#### DocumentReferences: Updating Documents

The server adds a `relatesTo relation` to the previous document. The status of the previous document is set to
`superseded` by the server.

#### DocumentReferences: KDL Code Mapping

The server completes any missing `XDS` class and type codes using the transmitted `KDL` code and returns them in
`DocumentReference.type` or `DocumentReference.category`. The `XDS` codes determined from the `KDL` code using the
ConceptMaps published as part of the [KDL specification](https://simplifier.net/kdl). The `XDS` codes are required for
cross-institutional document exchange via `IHE XDS` or `MHD` or for the transmission of documents to the patient's
`ePA`.

#### DocumentReferences: Generating Metadata - `DocumentReference/$generate-metadata`

The server supports the Operation of generating of metadata as described in the
official [ISiK v5 Specification](https://simplifier.net/guide/isik-dokumentenaustausch-stufe-5/Einfuehrung/Festlegungen/ErzeugenVonMetadaten?version=5.1.1)
or [ISiK v3 Specification](https://simplifier.net/guide/isik-dokumentenaustausch-v3/ImplementationGuide-markdown-AkteureUndInteraktionen-ErzeugenVonMetadaten?version=current).

> **Warning**
>
> Although `meta.profile` is not actually mandatory for ISIK v3 FHIR resources, the specification of the profile
`“https://gematik.de/fhir/isik/v3/Basismodul/StructureDefinition/ISiKBerichtBundle”` in `meta.profile` is currently
> mandatory for the correct creation of metadata. It is also mandatory to specify `meta.profile` in such a bundle for
> the
> composition: `"https://gematik.de/fhir/isik/v3/Basismodul/StructureDefinition/ISiKBerichtSubSysteme"`.
>
> For ISiK v5, the `meta.profile` must be explicitly set, for every FHIR Resource.

#### DocumentReferences: Updating Metadata - `DocumentReference/$update-metadata`

The server supports the Operation of generating of metadata as described in the
official [ISiK v5 Specification](https://simplifier.net/guide/isik-dokumentenaustausch-stufe-5/Einfuehrung/Festlegungen/Update?version=5.1.1)
or [ISIK-3 specification](https://simplifier.net/guide/isik-dokumentenaustausch-v3/ImplementationGuide-markdown-AkteureUndInteraktionen-Update?version=current).

#### DocumentReferences: Resource Validation on Server Start

The `example-fhir-resources.validation.enabled` flag controls whether example FHIR resources are validated during server
startup. Validation ensures resource integrity but significantly slows down the server's startup. By default, it is
disabled (set in `application.yml`) to speedup development. If you want to validate the example resources on startup,
enable the flag by adding the following VM option to your runtime configuration:

```
-Dexample-fhir-resources.validation.enabled=true
```

- **Enabled:** Average startup time on local dev machine ~58 s
- **Disabled:** Average startup time on local dev machine ~19 s
