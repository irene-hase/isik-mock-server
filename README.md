## About The Project

This is a simple implementation of ISiK Level 5 specifications to be used as a simulation for testing purposes. It
is based on the [HAPI FHIR Starter Project](https://github.com/hapifhir/hapi-fhir-jpaserver-starter).

> [!WARNING]
> ISiK Level 3 support in this Mock Server Implementation has reached the End-of-Life and will be removed with the next
> major release.
> If you want to test further against this Mock Server for ISiK Level 3, please use the latest 3.4.5 Version.

### Release Notes

See [ReleaseNotes.md](./ReleaseNotes.md) for all information regarding the (newest) releases.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java (JDK) installed: JDK 21 or newer.
- Apache Maven build tool (3.8+)
- Alternatively: Docker

### Installation

To build and run the mock server, you can use Docker or deploy the WAR file on a Apache Tomcat server.

#### Using Docker

You can run the server as a Docker Container with an in-memory Database by issuing the command:

```bash
docker run --rm -it -p 8080:8080 gematik1/isik-mock-server:latest
```

#### Using Docker Compose

You can run the server as a Docker Container with dedicated PostgreSQL Database by issuing the command:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

The server will then be accessible at http://localhost:8080/fhir and eg. http://localhost:8080/fhir/metadata after some
seconds (usually 30-60).

## Usage

Once started the server is accessible at http://localhost:8080/fhir and the CapabilityStatement will be found
at http://localhost:8080/fhir/metadata.

Please refer to the main HAPI FHIR Jpa Server documentation for further information about the general server
functionality: [HAPI FHIR Jpa Server Documentation](https://github.com/hapifhir/hapi-fhir-jpaserver-starter/blob/master/README.md)

### ISiK-specific Features

#### Loading external Resources

This Mock Server comes with some example FHIR Resources that are loaded on startup. You can add your own resources by
providing a folder containing FHIR Resources in JSON or XML format.

To do this, you need to set the property `example-fhir-resources.directory` in the `application.yml` file to the path of
your folder. The server will then load all the FHIR Resources from that folder on startup.

If you use the Docker Image, you can mount a volume in the container to provide the folder with your custom resources.
For example:

```bash
docker run --rm -it -p 8080:8080 \
  -v /path/to/your/resources:/fhir-resources \
  -e EXAMPLE_FHIR_RESOURCES_DIRECTORY=/fhir-resources \
   gematik1/isik-mock-server:latest
```

#### General Design Decisions regarding ISiK

##### Non-acceptance of instances on CREATE that are not ISiK compliant

Although ISiK generally permits compatibility with non‑ISiK‑compliant instances for historical data (particularly when
returning data in a READ interaction), this server implementation does not adopt a liberal approach that would accept
such instances during a CREATE interaction. The server rejects CREATE requests if the supplied resources are not
conformant with an existing ISiK profile.

##### Instances that are not ISiK compliant

This ISiK server may persist instances that are not ISiK compliant. These emulate legacy or historical data which a
client should still be able to process in a READ interaction using appropriate error handling.

#### FHIR Resource Validation with the `gematik Referenzvalidator`

Every FHIR resource that is being sent to the server via a `POST` or `PUT` request is being validated with
the [gematik Referenzvalidator](https://github.com/gematik/app-referencevalidator) using
the [ISIK-5](https://github.com/gematik/app-referencevalidator-plugins/releases/tag/isik5-1.0.0) one. If a resource
is not valid it gets rejected and a response with an OperationOutcome containing the validation errors is being sent
back to the client. Only resources that are valid will be accepted.

Additional Details:

* Operations beginning with `/$..` (e.g. `$book`) are not validated with the Referenzvalidator. Validation for such
  operations happens internally.
* Resources without a mapped ISiK plugin are validated against the base FHIR core StructureDefinition.
* Invalid KDL codes from the 2025 ValueSet are treated as errors and will block persistence.
* Transaction, Document, and Searchset bundles are validated only against their matching ISiK profile (e.g.,
  `ISiKMedikationTransaction` for transaction bundles).

#### Accepted Media-Types

The server accepts XML and JSON. Clients can choose between XML and JSON representation, but must indicate which
representation has been selected in the HTTP Accept and Content-Type
headers, [cf. ISiK v5 Specification](https://simplifier.net/guide/isik-basis-stufe-5/Einfuehrung/Festlegungen/UebergreifendeFestlegungen_Repraesentationsformate?version=current)).
The validation of Media-Types is skipped only for `Binary` resources.

The server now validates the `fhirVersion` parameter in Accept/Content-Type headers and rejects anything other than
`4.0` (returns 406).

#### Booking Appointments - `Appointment/$book`

The server implements the Operation for booking Appointments according to the
official [ISiK v5 Specification](https://simplifier.net/guide/isik-terminplanung-stufe-5/Einfuehrung?version=5.1.1).

The `$book` operation accepts both a bare `Appointment` and a `Parameters` resource with named parameters (
`appt-resource`, `schedule`, `cancelled-appt-id`, `patient`, `related-person`).

Plausibility checks:

* Start date of the appointment must be in the future
* Status must be `proposed`
* serviceType must use the CodeSystem `http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/service-type`
* The referenced slot must have the status `free`
* The referenced patient must not have been deleted and must not have the status active=false
* The start and end times in the appointment must be identical to the slot start/end times or lie between them

Other implemented features:

* A slot that has already been claimed by a parallel request results in a response with error code `422`, or `409` in
  case of conflicts.
* When `patient` or `related-person` are supplied in Parameters, the server resolves existing or creates new resources.
* When `Appointment.start` / `.end` are not set but a Slot is referenced, values are populated from the Slot
* After enrichment, the fully-built Appointment is validated against the ISiKTermin profile using the gematik
  Referenzvalidator.
* If the status of an `Appointment` is one between `proposed`/`cancelled`/`waitlist`, the presence of start/end fields
  for these statuses is not validated
* The server automatically creates a busy Slot when none is provided — ensuring no overlaps and converting
  overlapping free slots — then associates it with the new appointment.
* The Feature Flag `isik.appointment.book.pending-enabled` has been introduced: when enabled, `$book` returns status
  `pending` (HTTP 202) instead of `booked` (HTTP 201)

#### Asynchronous Booking of Appointments

Clients can also book Appointments asynchronously. To do this they need to add a `Prefer-Header` that contains
`respond-async`. The server will then send a response with status `202` and a `Content-Location-Header` that contains
the url where the client can later access the result of the asynchronous booking job. To access the result of the
asynchronous job the client needs to do a `GET` request with the url from the `Content-Location-Header`.

#### Updating Appointments

The server implements updating Appointments according to the chapter `Aktualisierung / Absage eines Termins` from the
official [ISiK v5 Specification](https://simplifier.net/guide/isik-terminplanung-stufe-5/Einfuehrung/Festlegungen/Operations?version=5.1.1).
It supports **Patch (`PATCH`)** on Appointments using a `Parameters` resource, not a direct `PUT` of the full resource.

Plausibility checks:

* `Appointment.slot` MUST NOT be changed
* `Appointment.start` MUST NOT be changed
* `Appointment.end` MUST NOT be changed
* `Appointment.participant.actor.where(resolve() is Patient)` MUST NOT be changed
* The referenced patient MUST NOT be deleted and MUST NOT have the status `active=false`
* Immutable fields (`slot`, `start`, `end`, `participant.actor`) only accept `replace` operations and reject `add`/
  `remove`

#### Rescheduling Appointments

The server implements rescheduling of Appointments as described in the `cancelled-appt-id` parameter in the
official [ISiK v5 Specification](https://simplifier.net/guide/isik-terminplanung-stufe-5/Einfuehrung/Festlegungen/Operations?version=5.1.1).

* All plausibility checks from the chapter `Booking Appointments` need to be fulfilled here as well.
* A reference to the cancelled appointment is stored in the new appointment.
* The status of the cancelled appointment is set to `cancelled`.
* When an appointment transitions to `cancelled` (either via `$book` rescheduling or via PATCH), all referenced Slots
  are **automatically freed** (set back to `free`).

#### DocumentReferences: Pre-Storage enrichment

The server can enrich incoming `DocumentReferences` that are going to be created, including those inside transaction
Bundles. Embedded base64 encoded attachment data is extracted into a separate `Binary` resource and the attachment URL
is replaced with the Binary's URL.

The enrichment can fail if the referenced `Patient` or `Encounter` do not exist on the server.

#### DocumentReferences: Updating Documents

When a new DocumentReference includes a `relatesTo` entry with code `replaces`, the server automatically sets the status
of the referenced (previous) document to `superseded`.

#### DocumentReferences: KDL Code Mapping

The server completes any missing `XDS` class and type codes using the transmitted `KDL` code and returns them in
`DocumentReference.type` or `DocumentReference.category`. The `XDS` codes determined from the `KDL` code using the
ConceptMaps published as part of the [KDL specification](https://simplifier.net/kdl). The `XDS` codes are required for
cross-institutional document exchange via `IHE XDS` or `MHD` or for the transmission of documents to the patient's
`ePA`.

#### DocumentReferences: Generating Metadata - `DocumentReference/$generate-metadata`

The server supports the Operation of generating of metadata as described in the
official [ISiK v5 Specification](https://simplifier.net/guide/isik-dokumentenaustausch-stufe-5/Einfuehrung/Festlegungen/ErzeugenVonMetadaten?version=5.1.1).

#### DocumentReferences: Updating Metadata - `DocumentReference/$update-metadata`

The server supports the Operation of generating of metadata as described in the
official [ISiK v5 Specification](https://simplifier.net/guide/isik-dokumentenaustausch-stufe-5/Einfuehrung/Festlegungen/Update?version=5.1.1).

#### DocumentReferences: Resource Validation on Server Start

The `example-fhir-resources.validation.enabled` flag controls whether example FHIR resources are validated during server
startup. Validation ensures resource integrity but significantly slows down the server's startup. By default, it is
disabled (set in `application.yml`) to speedup development. If you want to validate the example resources on startup,
enable the flag by adding the following VM option to your runtime configuration:

```
-Dexample-fhir-resources.validation.enabled=true
```

when the validation is enabled, the startup time might vary significantly based on the number of example resources and
the performance of the machine, but it can take up to several minutes.

#### Document Bundles

The server handles incoming `Bundle` Resources with `Bundle.type = DOCUMENT`, validating the following requirements:

* The `Composition` has a narrative (`text`)
* The `Patient` (subject) exists on the server (searched by identifier)
* The `Encounter` exists on the server (searched by identifier)

#### Transaction Bundles

The server supports Requests with transaction `Bundles`, accepting `Bundle` Resources with `Bundle.type = TRANSACTION`:
it validates incoming transaction bundles against the `ISiKMedikationTransaction` profile and for outgoing
transaction-response bundles, the server enriches them with `Bundle.meta.profile` set to
`ISiKMedikationTransactionResponse` and derives `Bundle.entry.fullUrl` from `entry.response.location`.
